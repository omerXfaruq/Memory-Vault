Hello üëãüèª

Memory Vault is a telegram bot that stores your notes and reminds random notes every day.

Keeping note of beautiful & important stuff that we come across throughout the life, and later remembering them in the future is quite difficult isn't it üòî?
Here is the Memory Vault for the rescue! Memory Vault solves this problem with a very simple and easy to use method üòé. Because, complex methods makes it harder to keep them in our life.
Here is the catch, I will definitely send you each memory you give to me one day. And you don't need to think over when I will send it.
Sincerely thanks to my dear wife Seyyide for the beautiful idea.
