Hello √ñmer Faruk üëãüèª

Keeping note of beautiful & important stuff that we come across throughout the life, and later remembering them is quite difficult isn't it üòî? Here is the Memory Vault for the rescue! Just take your notes, and I will randomly remind them everyday üòé

Unfortunately in this era our days&agendas are very busy and it is very hard to follow something consistently. Memory Vault helps us on this front by continuously reminding our notes daily, so that we won't ever forget them. 

‚ù§Ô∏è Sincerely thanks to my dear wife Seyyide for the beautiful idea.
